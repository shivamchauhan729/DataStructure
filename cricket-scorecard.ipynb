    "\n",
    "Design a cricket scorecard that will show the score for a team along with score of each player.\n",
    "You will be given the number of players in each team, the number of overs and their batting\n",
    "order as input. Then, we can input overs ball by ball with the runs scored on that ball (could be\n",
    "wide, no ball or a wicket as well).\n",
    "You are expected to print individual scores, number of balls faced, number of 4s, number of 6s\n",
    "for all the players from the batting side at the end of every over. You also need to print total\n",
    "score, total wickets. Essentially, you need to keep a track of all the players, strike changes (at\n",
    "the end of the over or after taking singles or 3s) and maintain their scores, also keep track of\n",
    "extra bowls that are being bowled (like wides or no balls). You also need to print which team\n",
    "won the match at the end.\n",
    "This is the bare minimum solution which is expected for the problem. You can add some more\n",
    "features once you are done with these, like maintaining bowlers record (total overs bowled, runs\n",
    "conceded, wickets taken, maiden overs, dot balls, economy, etc.). Total team extras, batsman\n",
    "strike rates, etc. can be added too. But these are \"good to have\" features, please try to complete\n",

    "3. I have also kept in mind when ball is wide, number of balls must be thrown in appropriate number and the runs are incremented accordingly. Also when wicket falls, score remains same but new player comes \n",
    "4. Used different data structures like list, dict, defaultdict, numpy array and its operations\n",
    "5. Also used pandas for storing the scorecard into dataframes\n",
    "6. At the end the dataframes for the performance of both the teams are stored in separate csv files, so that in future that could be used for some analytical purpose."
